Strings have double quotes, characters have single quotes
-look at StringDemo from class examples
-length method measures length of the string
-learning how to use the Java API, there will be listed constructors with summaries, although they are not all user friendly
-substring, even though it counts from 0, it doesn't count directly 0-5 (example), endIndex - 1
-homework will use strings in a loop and non-loop scenario
-now StringsDemo, creating an array of strings, note the difference between a for-each loop and a regular for loop
-for homework, prof gives us some use cases examples, we don't have to use them but it might be easiest to use them
-field, constructor, method are the types of members a class can have
-you cannot make a method call without parentheses, every string has a length method, every array has a length field, an array is an object
-strings are immutable, once strings are created they cannot be changed, 
-ternary operator
-if x is less than 0, then y = 10: if it is false, then y = 20
-for question number 5 check out Class ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException



String[] daysOfWeek = new String[7]

quiz: 

1) type
2) String[] daysOfWeek = new String[7]
3) String[] dw = { "Monday", "Tuesday"};
4) take a look at the For Each example, for(String s : dw //like in number 3// )
System.println.out(s);
5) has something to do with length vs index and printing, read up to get this one!
6) yes
7) boolean
8) command line arguments
9) check out example if x is less than 0, then y = 10: if it is false, then y = 20
, write this as code 
10) false
