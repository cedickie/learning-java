Class notes for Java session 4

classes, constructors
-constructor, or new object is said to create new memory, the object has to be stored somewhere
-dot operator, calls a method, in order to do that we need an object on which to call the method (using the HelloWorld demo for reference)(also using HelloDefaultConstructor)

-the basics: defining a method, creating an object, using the method to call on the object
-fields or instance variables are sometimes called attributes or data
-method is sometimes called behavior
-if there is a dot operator, there has to be an object on the left

-constructor versus method
method has return type of string, if we don't want to return a string use a void method, with void methods, there is the option to add a return as a conditional way to break out of method, you are never required to use a return but you are allowed to.
-matching signatures, matching data types and order

-check out ParameterDemo and ParamertizedConstructorDemo - the homework will be similar to this, the homework should also include a main

-the purpose of constructors: to , the object, don't have to use a customized constructor
-you can only use a given signature once
-program will not run without main, main does not necessarily need the class file included within it
-in professional programming, there may be many small class files that don't include main. Then there may be a different main that can call each class file. It's a little bit more difficult if files are in different directories

terminology:
	you create an object, you define a constructor
	
Quiz Stuff:

1) instance variable or length field, not the method (? i think)
2. property - good to know that there are multiple names for the same things
3. should be verbs, the behavior of the object
4. class
5. lower case, upper case
6. for a void method, it will stop the method, in a method that is not void, it will return the return value 
7. false
8. argument, what makes a parameter formal is that the data type is specified (i.e. int i), during the runtime argument, the data type does not need
to be specified
9. object
10. dot

-Garbage Collection
	-frees up memory so that we don't have to overwrite a place in memory, looks for whether anything wants to use a specific object name, periodically it'll go through and clear up memory, can create a finalize method, use the keyword static in order to avoid creating an object
