1. A string has the length() method to represent its number of characters. An array has the instance variable or length field 
to represent its number of elements, whether populated or not.

2. Another name for an instance variable is data, attribute, field, or property.

3. Unlike C or C++, Java does not use the term "function" or "procedure". The Java term for the code that defines behavior on an object
is method, and the method name should not be a noun but rather a verb.

4. A constructors' name must match that of the class for which it performs initialization when an instance is created.

5. By convention, a method name begins with a lower case letter while a constructor name begins with a capital letter.

6. What does the keyword "return" do to the execution of a method that is void? What does the keyword "return" do if the method is not void?
For a void method, it will stop the method. In a method that is not void, it will return the value.

7. True or false: Like a void method, a constructor must specify a return value of void.
False

8. If a forma parameter is specified in a method definition, a call to that method must include a runtime argument of a matching 
data type.

9. The new operator allocates memory for a newly created object.

10. To call a method on an object (or of a class), or to access the instance variables of an object (or static variables of a class),
use the dot operator between the name of the object (or class) and the name of the method.
