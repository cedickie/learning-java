Class Notes 6/27/11

-the dot operator grants access to a member of the class
-good to note that multiplication will come before addition or subtraction, it does not matter the order in which the equation is written, unless, of course, parentheses specify otherwise

Program Controls

if Statement is probably the easiest to understand
-first condition is "if," ones in the middle are "else if" the last one is just "else."

Loops loops loops
-can get the same logic using "while" or "for"
-decide when to use while, for, or do. Typically don't use while because you can use for, for is conventional, do will prompt another loop

-compiler wants you to be concise, it doesn't like duplicate code

-for loop is the most common loop, there are uses for the infinite loop too!

skipping ahead to object oriented java
-the constructor does the initialization 
-there is a default constructor that's invisible, can add a customization 
, you still have to call some constructor, whether that's the default or the custom constructor
-must know the difference between the method call and the method definition
-need to know the difference between the constructor and the method, methods can be polymorphic
-an object is an instance of a class
